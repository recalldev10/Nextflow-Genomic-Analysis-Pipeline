# Nextflow Genomic Analysis Pipeline

A bioinformatics pipeline for processing and analyzing DNA sequencing data using Nextflow and Bowtie2.

## Description

This project implements a modular genomic data processing pipeline using Nextflow for workflow management and Bowtie2 for sequence alignment. The pipeline consists of three main components:

1. FASTQ Processing: Quality control and trimming of raw sequencing data
2. Sequence Alignment: DNA sequence alignment against an E. coli reference genome
3. Automated Workflow: Integration of all steps into a reproducible Nextflow pipeline

The pipeline is designed to handle next-generation sequencing (NGS) data and produce alignment results in standard bioinformatics formats.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Nextflow (v21.04.0 or later)
* Bowtie2 (v2.4.0 or later)
* Unix-based operating system (Linux or macOS)
* Java 8 or later
* At least 4GB RAM
* Sufficient storage space for sequence data

### Installing

1. Install Nextflow:
```bash
curl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash
```

2. Install Bowtie2:
Using conda:
```bash
conda install -c bioconda bowtie2
```
Or using apt (Ubuntu/Debian):
```bash
sudo apt-get install bowtie2
```

3. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/recalldev10/nextflow-genomic-pipeline
cd nextflow-genomic-pipeline
```

### Executing Program

1. Process FASTQ files:
```bash
nextflow run fastq_processing.nf -profile standard
```

2. Run sequence alignment:
```bash
nextflow run alignment.nf -profile standard --reference path/to/reference_sequence.fna
```

Input files should be placed in the appropriate directories:
- Raw FASTQ files in `./data/raw/`
- Reference genome in `./data/reference/`

Output files will be generated in the `./results/` directory.

## Help

Common issues and solutions:

* If you encounter memory errors, adjust the memory settings in nextflow.config
* For input/output errors, ensure proper file permissions in working directories
* For alignment issues, verify the reference genome index has been properly built
